To do
-----

 - Add background layer with original border graphics from SFE (changes:
    - Allow viewing of speed/score/chains;
    - Remove wins/losses;
    - Remove dancing guy;
    - Change logo.
 - Add speed/score/chains display.
 - Port menu system.
 - Add Simian Zombie logo as splash screen.
 - Blocks at bottom of grid should bounce when hit with garbage.  Blocks must
   therefore be part of the grid, which should remove some of the special cases.
 - Seems to be a bug in the garbage hit routine that leaves blocks with a
   y offset.

Possible
--------

 - Re-do all graphics/sounds.
