To do
-----


 - Either:
   - Allow viewing of speed/score/chains,
   - Remove wins/losses boxes from background graphic
   - Change logo.
   - Add speed/score/chains display.
 - Or:
   - Allow viewing of wins/losses.
   - Remove scoring/chain counting from engine code.
   - Track wins/losses.
 
 - Menu system.
 - Add Simian Zombie logo as splash screen.
 - Paused text.
 - Winner text.
 - Drag sprites down screen of losing grid at end of game session.
 - Play win/lose samples at appropriate times.
 - Have game display layer produce a scene object like the examples, as the
   scene is basically useless.
 - Try scrapping the "dropped half block" idea and multiply all y co-ords by 2.
   When the y co-ord is a multiple of 2, move it to the next grid block.  If the
   co-ord is not a multiple of 2 it has dropped a half block.
